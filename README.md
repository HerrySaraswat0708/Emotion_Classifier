# Emotion Classifier Project
This repository contains an emotion classifier project built using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a model that can classify text into different emotion categories.

# Overview
Understanding human emotions is crucial in various applications, such as sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and chatbots. The emotion classifier project aims to build a machine learning model that can analyze textual data and classify it into different emotion categories, such as happy, sad, angry, or neutral.

The Naive Bayes algorithm is employed for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks. The model learns from labeled data to make predictions on unseen text, allowing for emotion classification in real-world scenarios.

# Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset containing text samples and their corresponding emotion labels. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the Naive Bayes model for emotion classification. The text samples can be sentences, tweets, or any other type of textual data.

# Machine Learning Model
The emotion classifier model is built using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features. The algorithm calculates the conditional probability of each emotion label given the observed words in the text and selects the most probable emotion category.

The model training process involves preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features (such as word frequencies or TF-IDF), training the Naive Bayes model, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

# Usage
To use the emotion classifier model, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-classifier-project.git
2. Install the required dependencies. You can specify the dependencies and their versions in a requirements.txt file or provide installation instructions specific to your project.
3. Prepare and preprocess the labeled dataset. This may involve data cleaning, tokenization, removing stop words, or other preprocessing techniques specific to your text data.
4. Train the Naive Bayes model using the preprocessed dataset. Extract relevant features, such as word frequencies or TF-IDF, and fit the model to the training data.

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques. This may include calculating accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Consider using techniques such as cross-validation or confusion matrices to gain insights into the model's performance.

Use the trained model to classify emotions in new, unseen text data. Provide instructions on how to load the model and make predictions on textual inputs.
